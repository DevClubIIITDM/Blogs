Most terminals support this, but ymmv.\n  * If you work in a proportional context (GUI elements or edit a presentation etc) pick a font with `Nerd Font Propo` (or `NFP`).\n\n### Ligatures\n\nLigatures are generally preserved in the patched fonts.\nNerd Fonts `v2.0.0` had no ligatures in the `Nerd Font Mono` fonts, this has been dropped with `v2.1.0`.\nIf you have a ligature-aware terminal and don't want ligatures you can (usually) disable them in the terminal settings.\n\n### Explanation\n\nOnce you narrow down your font choice of family (`Droid Sans`, `Inconsolata`, etc) and style (`bold`, `italic`, etc) you have 2 main choices:\n\n#### `Option 1: Download already patched font`\n\n * For a stable version download a font package from the [release page](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases)\n * Direct links for [0xProto.zip](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/latest/download/0xProto.zip) or [0xProto.tar.xz](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/latest/download/0xProto.tar.xz)\n\n#### `Option 2: Patch your own font`\n\n * Patch your own variations with the various options provided by the font patcher (i.e. not include all symbols for smaller font size)\n\nFor more information see: [The FAQ](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/wiki/FAQ-and-Troubleshooting#which-font)\n\n[SIL-RFN]:http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=OFL_web_fonts_and_RFNs#14cbfd4a\n\n",
